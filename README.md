# QuarantineApplicationHackathon
The purpose of the application to enforce Quarantine Guidelines. For example, the city of New York has a mandatory 14 day quarantine, but they donâ€™t have a good way to enforce their policy. They could leverage this application to monitor travelers and ensure that they are staying within their quarantine facilities and or places of residence. 

The application heavily leverages Radar.io to track users and create a geofence that will ensure that users do not leave their place of residence.
